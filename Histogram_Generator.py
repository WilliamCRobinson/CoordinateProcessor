 Histogram Generator
 The purpose of this module is to provide users with a with a way to generate histograms for many MDCRD files at once
 with ease.

 The idea is that an undergraduate should be able to walk up to it and know exactly what to do and why.

I am deciding doing a module to complete this task, I think making a class would be overkill. 

    Firstly we need to understand the data structure we are dealing with before we can even start coding.
